# Network-Hardening-
Analysis of network hardening

# I was responsible for initiating network security practices. Making executive decisions about which tools to use based on what you know about certain vulnerabilities will be a starting point for helping the organization improve its network security. Explaining and documenting your decisions as a cybersecurity analyst will help in the future if the network ever needs to be troubleshooted. It will also help give non-technical employees buy-in and help them follow security practices, such as multifactor authentication. 

# The report includes information about adding general security hardening practices, a recommendation for how often the hardening practices should be performed, and an explanation of what the potential consequences are if the policy is not followed. 

~ Attached is the Security risk assessment report.
